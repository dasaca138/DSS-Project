    "The goal for our machine learning model is to help us predict the regular season winning percentages for NBA
teams. This model could be useful for incoming players deciding where they would like to play, or fans deciding what
teams to support. There is a need for this due to the lasting prominence of the sport at a global scale, and the growth
it has seen in fantasy sports and betting environments"
